# Scene-Recognition-with-Bag-of-Words

The purpose of this assignment is to get introduced to image recognition. Specifically, it includes implementing a classification approach for scene recognition starting with relatively simple methods. Specifically, it involves implementing bags of quantized local features with nearest neighbor classifiers and linear classifiers, learned by support vector machines.
